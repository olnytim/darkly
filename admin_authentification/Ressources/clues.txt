By using the dirb utility i found out about a htpasswd file located at http://192.168.95.227/whatever/ which contained a bunch of symbols that looked like a hash code, so i decided to use a hash convertor to check that. It was indeed, a hash code that was meant for a password for a user 'root', also the dirb showed an admin page, where i tried to login with the password and username i have discovered.
